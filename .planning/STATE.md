## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- Phase 1 upcoming: Per-field copy buttons instead of bulk copy (platform fields require individual paste)
- Phase 1 upcoming: Manual pricing only (user knows values, AI provides reference)
- Phase 11: Offline queue for AI processing (network may be unavailable during capture)
- All phases: Local-only storage (no cloud, keeps app simple)
- Phases 6-7: Two distinct listing tones (TradeMe formal, Facebook casual)
