## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

**Phase 1 (01-01):**
- Room over SQLDelight for better Kotlin coroutines integration
- Hilt over Koin for compile-time safety
- Min SDK 26 (Android 8.0) for 95%+ device coverage
- Material 3 with dynamic color for modern Android theming
- KSP for annotation processing (Room and Hilt)

**Earlier decisions:**
- Per-field copy buttons instead of bulk copy (platform fields require individual paste)
- Manual pricing only (user knows values, AI provides reference)
- Offline queue for AI processing (network may be unavailable during capture)
- Local-only storage (no cloud, keeps app simple)
- Two distinct listing tones (TradeMe formal, Facebook casual)
